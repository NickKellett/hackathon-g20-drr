Blocked drains and waterways are a leading cause of flooding in informal settlements. Programs that pay residents to clear debris combine disaster risk reduction with livelihood support. These initiatives build ownership, create jobs, and maintain critical infrastructure.  

This is important because government maintenance budgets are often stretched thin. By empowering residents, governments achieve both social and environmental benefits.  

### How to Put This Into Practice
- Identify high-risk drainage channels and assign routine cleaning tasks.  
- Provide small stipends or wages through cash-for-work programs.  
- Monitor outcomes to ensure long-term sustainability.  
- Link debris management to broader solid waste management strategies.  

### Example
In Manila, the Philippines, a government-backed program paid residents in flood-prone neighborhoods to regularly clear drains. This reduced localized flooding during monsoon rains while providing much-needed income.
