Pooling resources allows governments and communities to stretch limited budgets further by combining funds, materials, and labor. Shared resource models can support infrastructure improvements, emergency response supplies, and recovery funds.  

This is important because informal settlements often lack access to formal insurance or disaster relief. Pooling resources builds local resilience while strengthening social cohesion.  

### How to Put This Into Practice
- Establish community-managed disaster funds with government oversight.  
- Encourage shared ownership of equipment such as pumps, boats, or generators.  
- Provide matching grants to incentivize resource pooling at the local level.  
- Monitor transparency and accountability to build trust.  

### Example
In India, a government–community partnership created a pooled disaster risk reduction fund. Local contributions were matched by municipal government, financing drainage upgrades and emergency shelters.
