Not all residents are literate, and in emergencies, clear visual messages are often faster to understand than text. Using emojis, icons, or simple images ensures that critical warnings are understood regardless of literacy level or language barriers.  

This approach is especially useful when mobile phones or social media platforms are available, but also applies to printed posters, painted walls, or physical flags and signs. The key is consistency: once adopted, the same symbols must always carry the same meaning.  

### How to Put This Into Practice
- Develop a standard set of flood warning icons (e.g., rising water, evacuation route, safe shelter).  
- Train communities on what each icon means through public campaigns.  
- Integrate visuals into SMS alerts, public signage, and radio/TV graphics.  
- Ensure that color-blind accessibility and cultural sensitivity are considered.  

### Example
In the Philippines, disaster agencies use a color-coded system of symbols for typhoon and flood warnings. These are shared across TV, social media, and community posters, helping even those with limited literacy act quickly.
