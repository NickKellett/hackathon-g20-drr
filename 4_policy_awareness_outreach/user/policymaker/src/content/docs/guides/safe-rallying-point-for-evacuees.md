A designated rallying point provides evacuees with a clear, safe destination during flood emergencies. These points allow for efficient delivery of aid, coordination of transportation, and accountability for displaced populations.  

This is important because confusion during evacuations can lead to loss of life. Centralized gathering points reduce chaos and allow responders to prioritize the most vulnerable groups.  

### How to Put This Into Practice
- Identify safe, elevated, and accessible locations such as schools or community halls.  
- Ensure rallying points are connected to evacuation routes.  
- Provide basic services like water, sanitation, and first aid.  
- Communicate rallying point locations to residents in advance.  

### Example
In Mozambique, schools are designated as safe rallying points during cyclones and floods. These sites are mapped, pre-stocked with relief supplies, and clearly communicated to communities ahead of storm season.
