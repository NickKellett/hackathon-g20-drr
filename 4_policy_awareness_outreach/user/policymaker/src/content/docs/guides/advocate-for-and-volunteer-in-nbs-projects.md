Nature-based solutions succeed when governments provide leadership and communities actively participate. Advocacy ensures that NBS projects are prioritized in policy agendas, while volunteering builds local ownership and reduces maintenance costs.  

This is important because many NBS projects fail without long-term commitment. Advocacy and volunteering strengthen accountability and sustainability.  

### How to Put This Into Practice
- Integrate NBS advocacy into national disaster risk reduction frameworks.  
- Provide funding and recognition for community-led NBS initiatives.  
- Organize volunteer programs for planting, maintenance, and monitoring.  
- Showcase success stories to build public and political support.  

### Example
In Kenya, government programs supported community volunteers to restore riparian vegetation along rivers. The initiative reduced erosion and floods while creating green jobs for youth.
