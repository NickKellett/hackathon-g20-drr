Nature-based solutions (NBS) reduce flood risks while enhancing ecosystems. Wetlands, mangroves, and urban green spaces absorb excess water and reduce runoff, complementing engineered infrastructure.  

This approach is important because NBS are often cheaper, more sustainable, and multifunctional compared to hard infrastructure alone. They also deliver co-benefits such as biodiversity conservation, recreation, and climate mitigation.  

### How to Put This Into Practice
- Integrate NBS into national and municipal flood management strategies.  
- Restore wetlands, mangroves, and riparian buffers in flood-prone regions.  
- Provide incentives for private landowners to maintain green infrastructure.  
- Monitor outcomes to demonstrate cost-effectiveness.  
- Multi- or Re-purpose public or private land for flood mitigation and adaptation projects. Work with landowners to convert land into more flood resistant areas (unused land, golf courses, parking lots, etc).

### Example
Vietnam restored mangrove forests along its coastlines to reduce storm surge impacts. The program significantly lowered flood damage while creating new sources of income from fishing and eco-tourism.
