Some land is too risky for permanent settlement but can be used to absorb floodwaters or serve as adaptive infrastructure. Repurposing such areas can reduce exposure while providing co-benefits for communities.  

This is important because unplanned urban expansion often increases flood vulnerability. Proactive land use planning enables governments to reduce risk while creating social or ecological value.  

### How to Put This Into Practice
- Designate floodplains as parks, gardens, or water retention areas.  
- Use zoning laws to prevent new settlements in high-risk areas.  
- Compensate or relocate households where necessary to repurpose land.  
- Incorporate community participation in land-use decisions.  

### Example
In Curitiba, Brazil, the city converted flood-prone land into public parks and artificial lakes. This reduced flood risk while enhancing recreation and urban biodiversity.
