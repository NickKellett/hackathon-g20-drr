## Early Warning Systems and Evacuations
- Can invest and assist in the creation of peer-to-peer phone networks, mesh networks, and/or upgrade cell towers to ensure the infrastructure has capacity to handle phone alerts.
- Repurpose the existing, or begin expanding, the power-grid inside informal communities to have bells or alarms that warn of imminent flooding.
- Ensure these warnings include actionable language that identifies safe areas for residents to rally.
- Phone alerts need to consider accessibility and literacy considerations.


## Improve Community Resilience
- Unless absolutely necessary, evictions are known to be unpopular and highly disruptive to local communities. As such, formalizing these settlements may be the best course of action. Land surveys to build floodwalls and other flood mitigation projects will be necessary in conjunction to home improvements. 
- Water and electricity service improvement will also be necessary as part of the formalization.
- Doubles as improvements to infrastructure needed for Early Warning Systems and facilitates evacuations.


## Apply Nature-Based Solutions (NBS)
- Multi- or Re-purpose private land for flood mitigation and adaptation projects. Work with landowners to convert land into more flood resistant areas (unused land, golf courses, parking lots, etc).
- Multi- or Re-purpose public land for flood mitigation and adaptation projects (unused land)
