The effectiveness of technology-driven early warning systems depends on whether residents have access to mobile phones. In some settlements, phone ownership is widespread, while in others it is limited by poverty, gender inequality, or unreliable networks. Governments must assess coverage and ownership before investing heavily in digital-only systems.  

This question is also about equity: policies must avoid excluding groups without digital access. Parallel systems such as sirens, community radios, or door-to-door messaging may be required to ensure inclusivity.  

### How to Put This Into Practice
- Conduct surveys to estimate household phone ownership and mobile network reliability.  
- Work with telecom providers to map coverage gaps and explore solutions.  
- Implement redundant communication systems for populations without phones.  
- Subsidize access where appropriate, especially for vulnerable groups.  

### Example
In Kenya, government agencies found high mobile penetration in urban settlements but far lower levels in rural floodplains. As a result, SMS-based alerts were combined with community radio broadcasts to ensure broad coverage.
