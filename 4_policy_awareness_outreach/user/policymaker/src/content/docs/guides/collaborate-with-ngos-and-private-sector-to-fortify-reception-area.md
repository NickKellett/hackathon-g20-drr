Reception areas often require additional investment to become fully functional shelters. Governments can work with NGOs, businesses, and international partners to provide infrastructure, supplies, and services. Such collaboration ensures that shelters meet humanitarian standards and can support evacuees for extended periods.  

This is important because overstretched government budgets may not be able to provide all necessary resources. Leveraging partnerships expands capacity and resilience.  

### How to Put This Into Practice
- Unless absolutely necessary, evictions are known to be unpopular and highly disruptive to local communities. As such, formalizing these settlements may be the best course of action. 
- Engage NGOs for technical expertise in shelter design and management.  
- Partner with businesses for donations of goods and services (e.g., food, water, sanitation).  
- Formalize agreements that clarify roles and responsibilities.  
- Involve community leaders to ensure culturally appropriate facilities.  
Land surveys to build floodwalls and other flood mitigation projects will be necessary in conjunction to home improvements. 
- Water and electricity service improvement will also be necessary as part of the formalization.
- Doubles as improvements to infrastructure needed for Early Warning Systems and facilitates evacuations.

### Example
In the aftermath of Cyclone Idai, the government of Zimbabwe partnered with NGOs and local businesses to improve reception areas. Contributions included water tanks, portable toilets, and food supplies, which significantly enhanced shelter quality.
