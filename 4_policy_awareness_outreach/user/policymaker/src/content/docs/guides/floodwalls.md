Floodwalls can be an effective measure to protect urban neighborhoods or critical assets such as hospitals, power stations, and schools. However, they require careful design, ongoing maintenance, and integration with natural drainage systems to avoid unintended consequences.  

This step is important because while structural measures can reduce risk, they can also create new vulnerabilities if they fail or are poorly maintained. Governments must weigh costs, long-term sustainability, and equity when planning floodwalls.  

### How to Put This Into Practice
- Conduct feasibility studies to identify cost-effective and safe locations.  
- Integrate floodwalls into larger flood management strategies, including nature-based solutions.  
- Establish maintenance budgets and assign responsibility clearly.  
- Communicate openly with residents about both benefits and limitations.  

### Example
The Netherlands employs floodwalls and dikes as part of an integrated water management system. Their success lies not only in construction but in regular inspection, maintenance, and public awareness campaigns.
