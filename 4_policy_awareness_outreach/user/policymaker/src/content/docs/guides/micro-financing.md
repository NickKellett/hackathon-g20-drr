Micro-financing provides small loans and savings opportunities for low-income households, enabling them to invest in flood-resilient housing, diversify livelihoods, or recover more quickly after a disaster.  

This is important because traditional banks often exclude poor or informal residents, leaving them with no safety net. Government-supported micro-finance programs can fill this gap while promoting economic inclusion.  

### How to Put This Into Practice
- Partner with micro-finance institutions (MFIs) to target flood-prone communities.  
- Offer subsidized interest rates or partial loan guarantees.  
- Link micro-finance to resilience outcomes, such as improved housing or livelihood diversification.  
- Monitor repayment systems to prevent over-indebtedness.  

### Example
Bangladesh pioneered micro-financing for rural communities vulnerable to cyclones and floods. These programs enabled households to rebuild faster and invest in small businesses, reducing long-term vulnerability.
