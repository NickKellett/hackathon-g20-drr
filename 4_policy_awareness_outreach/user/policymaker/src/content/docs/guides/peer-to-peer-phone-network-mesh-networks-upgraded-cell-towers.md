Where residents have phones, governments can enhance resilience by investing in peer-to-peer communication networks, mesh networks, or strengthening cell towers. These systems allow warnings to spread even when parts of the grid are down, creating redundancy in communications.  

This is important because traditional networks often fail during disasters due to overload or physical damage. Mesh and peer-to-peer technologies ensure that communication can bypass damaged infrastructure, keeping communities connected.  

### How to Put This Into Practice
- Work with telecom providers to upgrade cell towers in flood-prone areas.  
- Pilot mesh networks in informal settlements where coverage is weak.  
- Provide training on peer-to-peer apps that work offline.  
- Ensure backup power solutions for towers and key communication hubs.  

### Example
After hurricanes disrupted networks in Puerto Rico, pilot mesh networks allowed residents to share messages without cell towers. Governments are now exploring integrating these systems into formal disaster communication plans.
