Governments play a critical role in ensuring that residents understand flood risks and know how to respond. Sharing knowledge involves public education, transparent communication, and collaboration with schools, media, and civil society.  

This is important because misinformation and lack of awareness can undermine even the best flood management systems. Knowledge-sharing strengthens both community trust and the legitimacy of government interventions.  


### How to Put This Into Practice
- Integrate flood risk education into school curricula.  
- Use mass media and social media for public awareness campaigns.  
- Publish open-access flood maps and early warning information.  
- Partner with civil society organizations to reach marginalized groups.  

### Example
After severe floods in Thailand, the government launched a national flood risk awareness campaign. Posters, radio broadcasts, and school lessons helped ensure that risk knowledge was shared widely and consistently.
