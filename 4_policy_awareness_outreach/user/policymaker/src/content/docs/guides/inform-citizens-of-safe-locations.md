Even the best-prepared evacuation plan fails if citizens do not know where safe locations are. Governments must ensure residents are regularly informed about designated shelters and rallying points.  

This is critical in informal settlements where residents may be recent arrivals or lack access to official communication channels. Multi-channel communication, from door-to-door visits to mass media, is essential.  

### How to Put This Into Practice
- Publish and distribute maps showing shelters and rallying points.  
- Conduct regular community outreach campaigns.  
- Partner with schools, faith groups, and NGOs to spread information.  
- Update and re-communicate locations whenever they change.  

### Example
Following floods in Jakarta, Indonesia, authorities used community radio and posters at markets to inform residents of safe shelters. This ensured even migrants and day laborers knew where to evacuate.
