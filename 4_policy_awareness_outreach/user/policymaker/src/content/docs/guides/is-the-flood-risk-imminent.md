For government agencies, distinguishing between imminent and long-term flood risk is essential for decision-making. Imminent risks require emergency actions such as evacuations, rapid communication, and mobilization of resources. Long-term risks allow for infrastructure planning, zoning regulation, and community adaptation strategies.  

This assessment often depends on hydrological forecasts, rainfall data, and river basin monitoring. Governments must invest in both technical modeling and communication mechanisms to ensure timely recognition of evolving risks.  

### How to Put This Into Practice
- Establish real-time monitoring of rainfall, river levels, and dam storage.  
- Coordinate with national meteorological and disaster management agencies.  
- Develop clear triggers that define when “imminent risk” protocols are activated.  
- Communicate the risk promptly to local governments and frontline responders.  

### Example
In Bangladesh, the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) provides 3–5 day forecasts of river floods. Once thresholds are crossed, national authorities escalate alerts to district officials, who then activate evacuation and shelter protocols.
