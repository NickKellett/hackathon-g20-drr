Flooding often disrupts water supply and electricity, compounding the crisis. Improving the resilience of utilities helps communities maintain essential services during and after floods. For governments, this requires both infrastructure upgrades and contingency planning.  

This is important because waterborne disease outbreaks and power outages are common after floods. By strengthening utilities, officials protect public health and speed recovery.  

### How to Put This Into Practice
- Elevate water pumps, electrical transformers, and substations above flood levels.  
- Establish backup generators and water storage systems.  
- Train utility staff in emergency response procedures.  
- Coordinate with disaster management agencies to prioritize service restoration.  

### Example
In Durban, South Africa, the municipality upgraded electrical substations in flood-prone areas by raising them above projected flood levels. This reduced service interruptions and improved community resilience.
