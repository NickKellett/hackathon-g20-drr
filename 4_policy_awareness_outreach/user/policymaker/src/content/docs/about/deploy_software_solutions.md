title: Deploy Software Solutions
description: Deploy Solutions connects Earth observation data with the needs of organisations and businesses by providing innovative Space Apps — software applications which use data from space. Our main focus is on climate change-related use cases, in particular for physical risk and resilience. Since 2019 we've been gathering unique insights into the ways software can help prepare individuals and communities deal with climate change-related problems, impacts and natural disasters. We are a member of Space Canada.

## Our Vision

Climate Change is real, caused by humans, occurring now, and increasing in scope and threat. Everyone needs to work together to reduce its impacts. Our vision is to help build better climate resilience, using software tools and data from Earth and Space.

## Our Mission

We will accelerate the production of useful software tools and data for climate change resilience, adaptation, and mitigation use cases.

## Our Climate Change Research & Development

Software can't remove global warming gases from the atmosphere, stop the glaciers from melting, or lower sea levels. But it can help us better prepare, mitigate, adapt, respond, and recover from growing climate change impacts and disasters. Since 2019 we've been gathering unique insights into the ways software can help prepare individuals and communities deal with climate change-related problems, impacts and natural disasters. We have developed a unique software methodology for prototyping and building climate change-focused solutions, called OASIS4 Climate Change. Learn more at
