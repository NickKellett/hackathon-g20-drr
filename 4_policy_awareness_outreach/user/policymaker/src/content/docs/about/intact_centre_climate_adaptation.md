YOUR DESCRIPTION

        
	
## Transitioning from Rhetoric to Action: Integrating Physical Climate Change and Extreme Weather Risk into Institutional Investing (July 2023)

	
Written by Kathryn Bakos and Dr. Blair Feltmate, this report forms the basis of the Climate Risk Matrices framework we incorporated into the hybrid PRR logical model we are using in this application (as described elsewhere in this content).

	
As it is described on their website: "This report presents a practical means to factor climate change and extreme weather risk into institutional investing. Climate Risk Matrices (CRM) offer industry-specific standardization and are a practical tool to prioritize the top means by which climate-related events may negatively impact business continuity, while simultaneously identifying actions investors should expect a company to take to mitigate prioritized risks. "

	
## Climate-Ready Infographics

	
Intact Centre also publish numerous infographics to quickly summarize effective and inexpensive means Canadians can use to protect their homes and properties from perils including Extreme Heat, Flooding, and Wildfire.
