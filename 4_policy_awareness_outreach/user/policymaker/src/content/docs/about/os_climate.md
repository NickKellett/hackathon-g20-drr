description: OS-Climate is merged with FinOS

OS-Climate is an open-source initiative hosted by the Linux Foundation, building the data and analytics infrastructure needed to integrate climate risk into financial decision-making at scale.

OS-Climate has merged with FINOS, our sister project in the Linux Foundation.

OS-Climate joins FINOS as a Supplemental Directed Fund (the OS-Climate SDF) with a dedicated Governing Board, under the broader oversight of the FINOS Governing Board. It will continue to operate as OS-Climate.

This will increase OS-Climate's ability to help our members to address a wide range of pressing challenges in climate-related risk management, regulatory compliance, and finance and investment in transition opportunities.
