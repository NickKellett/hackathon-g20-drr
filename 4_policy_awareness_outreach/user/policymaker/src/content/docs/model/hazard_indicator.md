Hazard Indicators relate to Hazards. They are specific quantifiable thresholds or metrics that can be used to assess the likelihood or presence of a particular [Hazard]. For instance, a useful riverine inundation hazard indicator might be the height of the river level relative to the bank.

- Quantifiable thresholds or metrics that describe the severity or likelihood of the hazard, such as "10 cm water depth in a 1:200 year flood" or "wind speed exceeding 120 km/h."
- (If projected): Quantifiable thresholds signaling hazard severity.
- (If Realized): Observed thresholds during past disasters (e.g., water depth in specific locations, maximum wind speeds).
