Hazards are specific sources of the risk you face from a particular [Peril]. For instance, a “flooding” Peril might have a riverine inundation, pluvial indundation, urban, and other sources or types of flooding.

- The specific manifestation of the Peril in a given context, such as "coastal flooding caused by storm surge" or "flash flooding caused by heavy rainfall."
- Adds details like cause, location, or conditions.
- (If projected): Probability and magnitude of the peril (e.g., likelihood of a 1-in-200-year flood).
- (If Realized): Historical hazard data for calibration of projections (e.g., hydrological records, fire patterns).
