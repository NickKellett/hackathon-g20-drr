This model incorporates the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation's Climate Risk Matrices (CRM) framework, adapted to OS-Climate's physical risk and resilience model, to produce a hybrid and flexible assessment of the perils and recommended actions for physical infrastructure and assets under management.

- Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation's Climate Risk Matrices (CRM) framework which provides general risk assessments at a peril level, in Canada
- Adapted to OS-Climate's physical risk and resilience model which allows exposure and vulnerability assessments for various hazards done geospatially (place-locations) using open science data and algorithms.
- The combination is flexible enough to allow assessments a) without knowing much information about an structure, including its location and b) support more specific insight when the geography and other context-rich information is provided.
