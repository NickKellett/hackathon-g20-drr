A risk assessment is performed against a chosen structure, or for all assets within a community. It determines the overall risk posture given a set of perils, which are paired with the structure exposure and vulnerability.

YOUR DESCRIPTION

Rules: If something is not exposed then it is not vulnerable, and must not have any projected or actual impacts. If something is vulnerable then it must have projected or actual impacts, and must also be exposed. If there is determined to be a projected or actual impact, then it must mean that the structure is both exposed and vulnerable.
