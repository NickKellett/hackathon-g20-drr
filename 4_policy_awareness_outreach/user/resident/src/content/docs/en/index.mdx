Flooding is a coast-to-coast threat in all months of the year. Flooding typically occurs when prolonged rain falls over several days, when intense rain falls over a short period of time, or when an ice or debris jam causes a river or stream to overflow onto the surrounding area. Flooding can also result from the failure of a water control structure, such as a levee or dam. The most common cause of flooding is water due to rain that accumulates faster than soils can absorb it or rivers can carry it away. Approximately seventy-five percent of all disaster declarations are associated with flooding. Below are the most common flood hazards.
