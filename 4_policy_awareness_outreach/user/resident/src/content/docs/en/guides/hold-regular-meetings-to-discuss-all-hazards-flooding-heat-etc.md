Communities face many dangers—floods, heat waves, landslides, and storms. Holding meetings to discuss all hazards ensures people are ready for whatever may come. It also creates a culture of awareness and learning.  

This step matters because risks change over time. By meeting often, communities can update their plans, learn from past events, and keep preparedness fresh in everyone’s minds.  

### How to Put This Into Practice
- Set a regular meeting time, like the first Sunday of each month.  
- Use simple language and drawings so everyone understands.  
- Review past hazards and agree on small actions each time.  

### Example
One town held short monthly talks at the market. Topics ranged from keeping cool in summer heat to preparing sandbags for floods. These discussions kept preparedness part of everyday life.
