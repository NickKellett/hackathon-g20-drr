Reception areas—places where evacuees gather—are safer when supported by outside groups like government, NGOs, or local businesses. These partners can provide supplies, training, and improvements to shelters.  

This is important because communities often lack resources to prepare reception areas on their own. Collaboration ensures evacuees find food, water, and shelter when they arrive.  

### How to Put This Into Practice
- Invite NGOs or officials to visit and assess needs.  
- Ask businesses for donations like food, blankets, or tarps.  
- Share clear plans for how the reception area will be managed.  

### Example
In one town, a local shopkeeper provided extra rice and clean water for the school that served as a reception area. An NGO donated mats, making the place safer and more comfortable for evacuees.
