When residents receive warnings before floods arrive, they have precious time to act. They can collect belongings, move animals, and protect homes.  

This is important because vulnerable people—children, elders, and the sick—need extra time to move safely. Early action saves stress and prevents loss.  

### How to Put This Into Practice
- Keep a small bag of essentials ready to grab quickly.  
- Move valuable items higher up in the house.  
- Remind neighbors and check if anyone missed the warning.  

### Example
One family always kept a basket with dry clothes, medicines, and important papers by the door during rainy season. When the warning came, they left immediately and avoided danger.
