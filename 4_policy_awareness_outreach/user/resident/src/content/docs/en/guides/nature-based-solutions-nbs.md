Nature-based solutions use natural systems like trees, wetlands, and grasses to reduce flood risks. They slow water, absorb rainfall, and protect homes from erosion. Unlike concrete barriers, these solutions also provide shade, clean air, and food.  

This is important because poor communities often lack money for big infrastructure. Nature offers affordable and long-lasting protection that can be managed locally.  

### How to Put This Into Practice
- Plant trees along rivers to reduce erosion.  
- Restore wetlands that absorb excess water.  
- Protect mangroves or grasses that act as natural barriers.  

### Example
A riverside community planted bamboo along the banks. The bamboo reduced erosion during floods and also provided materials for building and crafts, giving families both safety and income.
