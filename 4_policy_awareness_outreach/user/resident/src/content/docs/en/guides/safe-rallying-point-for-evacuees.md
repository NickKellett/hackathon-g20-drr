When floods are coming, it is important for everyone to know a safe place where they can go. 
This is called a rallying point. It could be a school, a church, a community hall, or even a strong house on higher ground.  

A rallying point is important because during an emergency, people may panic or become confused. 
If the community already knows where to go, it saves time and prevents danger. It also makes it easier for helpers to bring food, 
water, or medical help to one central place.  

### How to Put This Into Practice
- Choose a building or open area that is not likely to flood.  
- Make sure the location is easy for everyone to reach, including children, elders, and people with disabilities.  
- Tell all neighbors about the place in advance, so no one is guessing when the flood comes.  
- If possible, keep simple supplies there: drinking water, dry food, blankets, or first aid items.  

### Example
In one village, people agreed that the schoolyard on the hill would be the rallying point. 
Whenever heavy rains came, families walked there together. Over time, they also stored a few cooking pots and blankets at the school, 
so everyone felt safer knowing they had a place to go.
