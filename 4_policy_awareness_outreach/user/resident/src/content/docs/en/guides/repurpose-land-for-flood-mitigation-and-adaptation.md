Some land is too risky for housing but can be used for other purposes that reduce floods. Repurposing land might mean turning flood-prone areas into parks, gardens, or spaces where water can safely collect.  

This is important because instead of fighting water, communities can give it space. This lowers flood damage while creating benefits like food or recreation.  

### How to Put This Into Practice
- Convert low-lying areas into community gardens or ponds.  
- Avoid building houses in zones known to flood.  
- Work with leaders to agree on safe land use.  

### Example
In one village, a floodplain was turned into a community garden that could withstand seasonal flooding. Families grew vegetables there, and during floods, the land safely absorbed water instead of damaging homes.
