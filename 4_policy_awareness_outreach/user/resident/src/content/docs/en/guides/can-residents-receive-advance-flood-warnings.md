Even a few hours of warning before a flood can save lives. Advance warnings give families time to pack belongings, move animals, and help elders reach safe ground.  

This step is important because many poor communities lack formal alert systems. Creating simple local warning systems fills this gap.  

### How to Put This Into Practice
- Ask local authorities how official warnings are sent.  
- Create community signals like whistles, bells, or painted flags.  
- Make sure volunteers are responsible for spreading news door to door.  

### Example
Farmers upstream in one valley agreed to phone or send messengers when water rose. This gave downstream families several hours’ notice to prepare.
