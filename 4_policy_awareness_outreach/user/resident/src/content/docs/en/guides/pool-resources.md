Most poor families cannot afford everything they need to face floods alone. By pooling resources, the community ensures that help is available to everyone. Shared tools, funds, and skills multiply the impact of limited resources.  

This step matters because when each family acts alone, the community is weaker. Together, they can afford to buy or build what no single household could.  

### How to Put This Into Practice
- Create a shared fund for emergencies.  
- Collect common tools like shovels or boats and keep them in a central place.  
- Share skills such as first aid or carpentry.  

### Example
A riverside community created a shared “emergency box” with ropes, flashlights, and first aid kits. Each family contributed a small item, and together they built a kit that saved lives during a flood.
