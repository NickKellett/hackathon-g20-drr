During an emergency, some people may struggle to leave their homes—elders, people with disabilities, or families with small children. A buddy-system pairs households or individuals together so that everyone has someone to check on them.  

This is important because panic and confusion can cause people to be forgotten. By making sure every person has a “buddy,” the community reduces the risk of lives being lost.  

### How to Put This Into Practice
- Pair each household with another nearby.  
- Assign youth volunteers to check on vulnerable people.  
- Practice the buddy-system in community drills.  

### Example
In one settlement, each family was linked to a neighbor. When the river overflowed, families checked on their buddies before evacuating. This simple system meant no one was trapped or forgotten.
