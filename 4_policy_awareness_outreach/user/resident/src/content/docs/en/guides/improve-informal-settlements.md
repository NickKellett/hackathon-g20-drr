Many families live in informal settlements with poor drainage, weak housing, and limited services. Improving these settlements makes them safer during floods and healthier year-round.  

This is important because weak structures collapse quickly, and poor sanitation worsens after floods. Simple improvements like stronger walls, raised floors, or better drains save lives.  

### How to Put This Into Practice
- Strengthen walls and roofs with local, durable materials.  
- Raise latrines and water sources above flood levels.  
- Work together to dig or repair drainage ditches.  

### Example
A hillside community replaced makeshift walls with stronger bamboo and mud plaster. They also dug shared drains. When the next rains came, water flowed away faster and fewer homes were damaged.
