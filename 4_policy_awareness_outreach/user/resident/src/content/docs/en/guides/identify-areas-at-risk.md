Not every part of a community floods equally. Some streets or houses are always first to fill with water. Identifying these areas makes it easier to protect lives and plan escape routes.  

This step matters because people who live in high-risk spots need more help and attention. Knowing risk zones also helps decide where to build safe gathering points.  

### How to Put This Into Practice
- Walk around after rains to see which places flood first.  
- Talk with elders who remember past floods.  
- Make simple maps marking danger areas.  

### Example
Residents in one settlement drew a chalk map on a wall. They shaded in the lowest streets where floods entered. New families could see instantly which places were unsafe.
