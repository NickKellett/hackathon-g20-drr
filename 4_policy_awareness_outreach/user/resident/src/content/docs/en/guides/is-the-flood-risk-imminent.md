Communities need to know whether a flood is likely in the future or arriving very soon. This decision shapes what actions to take. If a flood is imminent, the community must move quickly to safety.  

This is important because waiting too long can trap families in dangerous places. Early recognition of imminent floods helps avoid panic and saves lives.  

### How to Put This Into Practice
- Watch rivers, streams, and drains during heavy rain.  
- Set clear signals that mean “time to evacuate,” such as bells or drums.  
- Train children and youth to recognize rising water signs.  

### Example
In one riverside village, families agreed that if water touched a marked stone by the riverbank, it meant the flood was imminent. Children were responsible for running through the streets to sound the alarm.
