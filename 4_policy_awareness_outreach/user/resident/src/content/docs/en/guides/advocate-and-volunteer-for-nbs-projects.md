Nature-based solutions work best when communities actively support them. Advocacy means speaking up to leaders and organizations about the need for these projects. Volunteering ensures they are built, cared for, and maintained over time.  

This is important because outside groups may not act unless communities demand change. By volunteering, residents also gain ownership and pride in the projects.  

### How to Put This Into Practice
- Speak to local leaders about planting trees or restoring wetlands.  
- Offer time and labor to help with planting and maintenance.  
- Share success stories to encourage more investment.  

### Example
In one coastal settlement, families volunteered to plant mangroves along the shore. They also met with local officials to ask for support. Over time, the mangroves reduced wave damage and became a symbol of community strength.
