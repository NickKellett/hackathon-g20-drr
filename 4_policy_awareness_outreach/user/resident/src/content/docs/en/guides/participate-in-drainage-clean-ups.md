Blocked drains cause rainwater to back up and flood streets and homes. Regular clean-ups keep water flowing and prevent small floods from becoming disasters.  

This is important because in poor areas, trash and mud often block drains. Community action can fix this even when resources are limited.  

### How to Put This Into Practice
- Organize monthly clean-up days before rainy season.  
- Involve children and youth to spread the habit.  
- Separate trash so drains stay open longer.  

### Example
In one neighborhood, residents set aside one Saturday each month to clear drains together. Floodwaters that once rose to their doorsteps no longer reached their homes as often.
