After a flood, many families struggle to rebuild. Micro-financing provides small savings and loans so families can repair homes, buy supplies, or prepare for the next rainy season. Even tiny amounts can make a big difference.  

This is important because formal banks often ignore poor or informal communities. Local savings groups fill this gap and keep resources circulating within the community.  

### How to Put This Into Practice
- Start a community savings group where members contribute weekly.  
- Allow small loans with clear agreements for repayment.  
- Use part of the fund for emergency relief after floods.  

### Example
In one settlement, women created a savings group. Each week they contributed a few coins. After floods damaged homes, the group used the fund to buy roofing sheets and nails for the most affected families.
