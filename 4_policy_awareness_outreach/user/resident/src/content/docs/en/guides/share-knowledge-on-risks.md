Knowledge is power. When information about risks is shared openly, no one is left unprepared. Sharing knowledge means telling stories, teaching children, and making sure all groups understand the dangers and what actions to take.  

This is important because some people may not realize how serious floods can be or may not know what to do when water rises. Passing knowledge across generations ensures preparedness becomes a community habit.  

### How to Put This Into Practice
- Use meetings, schools, and religious gatherings to talk about flood risks.  
- Encourage elders to share memories of past floods.  
- Use drawings, plays, or songs to teach children.  

### Example
In one community, children created a play about floods and performed it at the market. The performance made people laugh and learn at the same time, reminding everyone how to act in an emergency.
