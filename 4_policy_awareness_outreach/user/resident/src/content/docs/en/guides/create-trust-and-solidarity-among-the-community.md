When neighbors trust one another, they are more likely to share news, help in times of danger, and cooperate on solutions. Trust grows slowly, but it is built through listening, honesty, and support during daily life, not only in emergencies.  

Solidarity means standing together when challenges come. This is important because floods can cause fear, but when people know they are not alone, they respond faster and recover more quickly.  

### How to Put This Into Practice
- Hold community events like shared meals or group clean-ups.  
- Involve all groups: women, elders, youth, and people with disabilities.  
- Build a culture of checking in on each other regularly.  

### Example
In one riverside settlement, neighbors started weekly group clean-ups of the drainage ditches. These gatherings not only improved flood defenses but also built lasting trust and friendships that proved vital when a flood struck.
