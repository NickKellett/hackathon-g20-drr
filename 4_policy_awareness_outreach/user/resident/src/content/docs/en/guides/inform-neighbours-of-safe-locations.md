When floods strike, people may panic or become confused. If everyone knows safe places in advance, like schools, high ground, or strong community halls, fewer lives are put at risk. Informing neighbors means no one is left guessing where to go or waiting until it is too late.  

This is important because some families may not hear warnings in time. By talking about safe locations before a flood, people can make plans to move together, check on elders, and avoid dangerous areas. Sharing this knowledge is one of the simplest and most powerful steps a community can take.  

### How to Put This Into Practice
- Make a clear list of safe places in the community.  
- Visit each household to share the information, especially those without phones or radios.  
- Use simple markers, like painted arrows or signs, to show directions to safe areas.  
- Remind people during regular community meetings.  

### Example
In a small village, young volunteers painted arrows on walls pointing toward the local schoolyard on the hill. They also visited homes of elderly residents to explain where to go if water rose. When heavy rains came, everyone moved quickly to the same place without confusion.
