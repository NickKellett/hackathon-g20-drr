Many people move into flood-prone areas because land is cheap or close to work. But every new home in a risky zone adds more lives in danger and makes community response harder. Discouraging settlement in these areas protects both newcomers and long-time residents.  

This step matters because prevention is better than cure. It is easier to stop risky settlement than to rescue people once floods arrive.  

### How to Put This Into Practice
- Share maps and stories showing which areas flood most often.  
- Encourage newcomers to build homes on safer land.  
- Work with local leaders to guide settlement patterns.  

### Example
In one low-lying settlement, community members warned new arrivals about frequent flooding. Many chose to build on slightly higher ground, reducing the number of families at risk.
