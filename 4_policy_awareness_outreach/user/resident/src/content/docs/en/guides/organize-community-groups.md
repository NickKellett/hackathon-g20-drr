A community is stronger when responsibilities are shared. Organizing into groups ensures that important tasks like spreading warnings, helping children, or gathering supplies are not forgotten.  

This matters because during floods, panic can set in. Clear roles and responsibilities reduce confusion and help the community respond as one.  

### How to Put This Into Practice
- Form small groups with specific duties such as health, communication, and logistics.  
- Appoint trusted leaders for coordination.  
- Encourage rotation of roles so many people gain skills.  

### Example
In a flood-prone neighborhood, three groups were created: one to sound alarms, one to guide children and elders to safety, and one to manage emergency supplies. Everyone knew their role, which made the evacuation faster and safer.
