During floods, some people hesitate to leave their homes. They fear losing possessions or think the water will not rise high. Encouraging residents to move early prevents emergencies from becoming tragedies.  

This step matters because the longer people wait, the more dangerous the evacuation becomes. Neighbors can support each other to make the move less frightening.  

### How to Put This Into Practice
- Share clear messages that leaving early is safer.  
- Walk together in groups to safe locations.  
- Provide reassurance that belongings can be replaced but lives cannot.  

### Example
In a flood-prone town, volunteers went door-to-door reminding families to move before nightfall. They offered to help carry children and belongings, which encouraged more people to leave in time.
