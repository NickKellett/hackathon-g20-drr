## Early Warning Systems and Evacuations
- Through a buddy-system, residents with access to early warnings assist residents without access.
- If certain residents cannot receive early warning alerts, the community should discourage new or current residents from occupying areas at risk of flooding.
- Ensure that all residents are aware of safe rallying points. Work with local businesses, NGOs, and relevant government agencies to ensure support for evacuated residents.

## Improve Community Resilience
- Improve drainage by participating in clean ups. 
- Monitor waterflow to ensure there aren’t any blockages that can risk the community.
- Pool resources within the community, both equipment and money, for community-led projects and recovery.
- Explore micro-financing within the community to encourage residents to save and to pool money for disaster mitigation.
- Share knowledge on risks to new residents through the regularly held community meetings.


## Apply Nature-Based Solutions (NBS)
- Advocate and volunteer for NBS projects: work with city officials to incorporate NBS solutions in surrounding land.
