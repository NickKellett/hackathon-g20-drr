YOUR DESCRIPTION

YOUR DESCRIPTION

- Use Functional Groups: Classify actions into Preparedness, Response, Recovery, Adaptation, and Mitigation without creating separate elements.
- Tie Actions to Targets: Each action should explicitly state which elements it affects (Exposure, Vulnerability, Impact).
- Quantify Impact: Include attributes for Effectiveness or Risk Reduction Scores to model changes dynamically.
- Enable Iteration: Allow Risk Reduction Actions to feed back into the Risk Assessment process, refining subsequent evaluations.
- If an structure is not Exposed to a hazard, there’s no possibility of an impact, regardless of its vulnerability. A RiskReductionAction that reduces Exposure (e.g., relocation) can eliminate or reduce the potential for an Impact.
- If an structure is not Vulnerable to a hazard, it will not sustain an impact, even if exposed. A RiskReductionAction that reduces Vulnerability (e.g., strengthening building materials) reduces the severity of the Impact.
- Impact is not an independent variable but a consequence of Exposure and Vulnerability. Therefore a reduction in Impact must stem from reducing Exposure (the likelihood of interaction with the hazard) or Vulnerability (the susceptibility to harm).
