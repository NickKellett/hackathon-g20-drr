## Workstream Goal
Apply policy-relevant reporting and guidance, awareness and outreach including early warning system information, disaster risk reduction, adaptation and resilience to relevant stakeholders including policy makers, public safety, and settlement community members.

## Approach
- Identify stakeholder audiences
- Create policy decision trees
- Derive content from decision steps and processes
- Create websites for each primary stakeholder audience
- Select static web publishing templates which offer simple authoring tools to focus efforts on communication messages rather than flashy appearance
- Sample multilingual content, since Durban is the AOI supported several languages including English, Afrikaans, Zulu.
- Use AI translation engine to sample translate content into non-English languages

## Decision Trees
- Divided into two categories
1. Government-led decisions
2. Community-led decisions (with or without government support)
- These are a work in progress and reflect a high-level understanding of potential relevant policy actions
- We note that certain government-led policies that could apply - such as those relating to mandatory evacuations and resettlements - are controversial and may well be resisted by informal settlement community leaders and members.
- We are not advocating for or against any particular policy steps or approach, simply indicating via these decision trees how policy actions could apply to the settlement detection, growth, and flood risk prediction models we produced.
