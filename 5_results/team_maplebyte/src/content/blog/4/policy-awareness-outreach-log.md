## Workstream Goal
Apply policy-relevant reporting and guidance, awareness and outreach including early warning system information, disaster risk reduction, adaptation and resilience to relevant stakeholders including policy makers, public safety, and settlement community members.

## Approach
- Identify stakeholder audiences
- Create policy decision trees
- Derive content from decision steps and processes
- Create websites for each primary stakeholder audience
- Select static web publishing templates which offer simple authoring tools to focus efforts on communication messages rather than flashy appearance
- Sample multilingual content, since Durban is the AOI supported several languages including English, Afrikaans, Zulu.
- Use AI translation engine to sample translate content into non-English languages
