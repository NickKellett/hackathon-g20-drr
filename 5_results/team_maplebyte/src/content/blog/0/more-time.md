Time keeps on slipping into the future. But if we had more of it:

## In General
- Use commercial high resolution satellite imagery to produce more fine-grained settlement detection, growth, and flood risk predictions
- Form partnerships with local NGOs, international aid organizations, South African governments at different levels would help integrate the hackathon results into real world activities that are, or could be, of help to the informal settlement residents
- Obtain or work with partners to generate ground truth data and compare models against the ground truth data

## Settlement Detection
- Identify individual structures as geojson shapes instead of pixels

## Settlement Growth
- Compare predicted growth areas with actual land use / building constraints

## Flood Risk
- Incorporate other flood events
- Incorporate weather conditions and predicted climatological changes into the models

## Policy Awareness & Outreach
- More secondary research on existing studies of the area, its challenges
