Time keeps on slipping into the future. But if we had more of it:

## In General
- Use commercial high resolution satellite imagery to produce more fine-grained and recent settlement detection, growth, and flood risk predictions
- Form partnerships with local NGOs, international aid organizations, South African governments at different levels which would help integrate the hackathon results into real world activities that are (or could be) of help to the informal settlement residents
- Obtain or work with partners to generate ground truth data and compare models against the ground truth data

## Settlement Detection
- Identify individual structures as geojson shapes instead of pixels
- Identify flood risk-relevant attributes of structures such as their slope, surrounding surface and land cover, shrub or vegetation species and coverage

## Settlement Growth
- Compare predicted growth areas with actual land use / building constraints

## Flood Risk
- Incorporate other historic flood events
- Incorporate wet season/dry season into the model
- Incorporate weather conditions and predicted climatological changes into the models
- Incorporate a more automated data processing pipeline for physical risk and resilience

## Policy Awareness & Outreach
- More secondary research on existing studies of the area, its challenges
- Fully translate the Community Leaders microsite content into isiZulu
- Investigate potential of Nature-based Solutions (NbS) more fully

## Development / Infrastructure
- Convert the existing work into a "template" for use in other areas
- Produce a continuous integration/development (CI-CD) pipeline to deliver the code and content into production environment, and add monitoring and logging for operational purposes
