## G20 Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) Hackathon
### Background
South Africa is currently chair of the G20 group of countries. They are hosting a G20 Open Innovation Demonstrator Project on Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) taking place September 2 to 5, 2025. From the organizers' concept note, the hackathon:

> ...forms part of one of the proposed deliverables for the G20 Research and Innovation Working Group (RIWG) in 2025, namely to implement a Demonstrator Project under the broader theme of Disaster Risk Reduction using Open Innovation (DRR-OI). The G20 DRR-OI initiative aims to harness digital technologies, shared data systems, and collaborative problem-solving to enhance global resilience to disasters, particularly in water-stressed and climate-vulnerable regions.

> The Hackathon challenge will build on existing platforms and prior demonstrator projects and serves as a testbed for collaborative innovation with real-world application. Solutions developed will be presented at the G20 Research and Innovation Ministerial Meeting to be held on the 23rd September 2025, as an example of how Open Innovation can contribute evidence to global dialogues on urban risk, climate adaptation, and digital innovation for development.

### Hackathon Objective
>The G20 RIWG Hackathon will deliver accurate mapping and short‑term forecasting, which combined with flood‑hazard overlays will help plan services, target upgrades, and improve early‑warning systems. This challenge builds on data structures developed during the previous disasters. Participants will be asked to build an end‑to‑end pipeline that will deliver the following:
•	Change Detection – Identify recent growth in informal settlements.
•	Forecast Expansion – Predict development over 1–3 years.
•	Risk Classification – Overlay forecasts with flood hazard maps.
