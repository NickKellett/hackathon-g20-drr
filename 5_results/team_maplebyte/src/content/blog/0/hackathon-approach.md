### Team Formation
The G20 Hackathon organizers asked their member states to raise awareness of the hackathon goals and objectives, with the intent to have teams of 3-5 people participate.

Team MapleByte is a team of Canadians from industry and government, with a range of skills and expertise in flood detection, artificial intelligence, geospatial software development, Earth observation, and public safety and policy. 

We decided to add an additional outcome to the end-to-end-pipeline to identify and communicate relevant policies, risks, and adaptation and resilience measures to relevant stakeholders including policy makers, public safety officials, and of course members of the informal settlements.

## Picking An Area-of-Interest (AOI)
We needed to pick an Area of Interest that a) had visible settlement growth over time and b) had detectible flooding and for which we could c) validate against documented "ground truth"

So we did some secondary research online and found a comprehensive article "A Perfect Storm" in The Outlier, written by Leonie Joubert with additional research and writing by Laura Grant, Gemma Ritchie and Gemma Gatticchi and support from Internews' [Earth Journalism Network](https://earthjournalism.net/).  
> "As the planet heats up, climate disasters will hit coastal cities with greater force. > Durban’s recovery from the April 2022 floods highlights the uncertainties such cities face and gives insight into how they can prepare for a sustainable and resilient future."
