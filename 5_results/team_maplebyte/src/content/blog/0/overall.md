## G20 Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) Hackathon
### Background
South Africa is currently chair of the G20 group of countries. They are hosting a G20 Open Innovation Demonstrator Project on Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) taking place September 2 to 5, 2025. From the organizers' concept note, the hackathon:

> ...forms part of one of the proposed deliverables for the G20 Research and Innovation Working Group (RIWG) in 2025, namely to implement a Demonstrator Project under the broader theme of Disaster Risk Reduction using Open Innovation (DRR-OI). The G20 DRR-OI initiative aims to harness digital technologies, shared data systems, and collaborative problem-solving to enhance global resilience to disasters, particularly in water-stressed and climate-vulnerable regions.

> The Hackathon challenge will build on existing platforms and prior demonstrator projects and serves as a testbed for collaborative innovation with real-world application. Solutions developed will be presented at the G20 Research and Innovation Ministerial Meeting to be held on the 23rd September 2025, as an example of how Open Innovation can contribute evidence to global dialogues on urban risk, climate adaptation, and digital innovation for development.

### Hackathon Objective
>The G20 RIWG Hackathon will deliver accurate mapping and short‑term forecasting, which combined with flood‑hazard overlays will help plan services, target upgrades, and improve early‑warning systems. This challenge builds on data structures developed during the previous disasters. Participants will be asked to build an end‑to‑end pipeline that will deliver the following:
•	Change Detection – Identify recent growth in informal settlements.
•	Forecast Expansion – Predict development over 1–3 years.
•	Risk Classification – Overlay forecasts with flood hazard maps.

### Team Formation
The G20 Hackathon organizers asked their member states to raise awareness of the hackathon goals and objectives, with the intent to have teams of 3-5 people participate.

Team MapleByte is a team of Canadians from industry and government, with a range of skills and expertise in flood detection, artificial intelligence, geospatial software development, Earth observation, and public safety and policy. 

We decided to add an additional outcome to the end-to-end-pipeline to identify and communicate relevant policies, risks, and adaptation and resilience measures to relevant stakeholders including policy makers, public safety officials, and of course members of the informal settlements.

## Picking An Area-of-Interest (AOI)
We needed to pick an Area of Interest that a) had visible settlement growth over time and b) had detectible flooding and for which we could c) validate against documented "ground truth"

So we did some secondary research online and found a comprehensive article "A Perfect Storm" in The Outlier, written by Leonie Joubert with additional research and writing by Laura Grant, Gemma Ritchie and Gemma Gatticchi and support from Internews' [Earth Journalism Network](https://earthjournalism.net/).  
> "As the planet heats up, climate disasters will hit coastal cities with greater force. > Durban’s recovery from the April 2022 floods highlights the uncertainties such cities face and gives insight into how they can prepare for a sustainable and resilient future."
